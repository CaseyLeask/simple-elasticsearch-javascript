# Installation / Dependencies

## Elasticsearch
```
brew install elasticsearch
```

Follow the instructions for starting elasticsearch specified in homebrew.

## Node
v8.15.0 or later is recommended, as we use `await` syntax.
I recommend https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#installation-and-update if you don't have a preferred, already installed Node version manager.
